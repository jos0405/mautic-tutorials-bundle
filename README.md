# ~~Guided Tutorials for Mautic~~
# Is called now Mautic Navigator Plugin

## Stage
This plugin is still in Beta.
Any feedback is appreciated: me@joeykeller.com

## What is this plugin about?

This plugin will get statistics from your Mautic into JoeyKeller.com Tutorials page.
No staticstics are saved or stored in any way, they are simply used for creating a suggested learning path for you.

## How does it work?

This plugin will give extend basic Mautic API and allow you to extract statistical information about your Mautic database.
No individual/contact/company related information is saved, only summary of data.
This information is used to understand how deeply you are using Mautic and suggest the next action you can/should do by using the system.

## Requirements
You need minimum php 7.4, Mautic 4+

## Does it work individually?

This plugin relies on a backend, that generates all the next steps, and guided tutorial experience. This logic is still in beta, and
I'm still tweaking it. You can freely connect your Mautic to the Tutorial Engine, that is on my server on JoeyKeller.com
